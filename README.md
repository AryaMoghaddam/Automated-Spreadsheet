# Automated-Spreadsheet
Let's say you're working on a series of spreadsheets to document a certain task that you have been assigned. For instance, you're working on documenting the labels and prices of the products of the hardware store you are working for. If you want to change the price or any detail of said products, it would take days or even weeks to go through every single spreadsheet to change it manually. My Python program not only automates this process but also creates a bar chart of all the updated data and showcases it with different colors to vividly indicate the changes made.
